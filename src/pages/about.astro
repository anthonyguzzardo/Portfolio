    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I'm Anthony Guzzardo, a Chicago-based software engineer focused on full-stack development, mobile apps, and scalable backend systems. I build products end-to-end — design, architecture, backend, frontend, mobile, and deployment.</p>

    <p>I’ve shipped production software across multiple industries, including social platforms, marketplace apps, payroll automation, and financial data pipelines. I move fast, avoid unnecessary meetings, and focus on shipping real, working software.</p>

    <h2>What I Work On</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mobile:</strong> SwiftUI, React Native, MapKit</li>
      <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Vapor (Swift), Node.js, PostgreSQL, REST APIs</li>
      <li><strong>Web:</strong> Astro, React, TypeScript</li>
      <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> AWS (ECS, RDS, VPC), containerized deployments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      <strong><a href="/rangley">Rangley</a></strong> is a location-based social meetup app for iOS. 
      I designed, built, and deployed the entire product — frontend, backend, infra — and launched it on the App Store.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I graduated from DePaul University with a computer science degree in 2023. Since then, I've worked on full-stack engineering roles at EL3 Tech and Treevah, built consumer mobile apps, architected backend systems, and developed an AI-assisted pricing and deal-generation engine for a retail marketplace.</p>

    <p>I operate under the Mr. Fox name as a personal brand for side projects and products I build. It’s not an agency — just the umbrella for the work I design and ship.</p>
